There are many interesting facts behind my entrepreneurship that cannot be told at other times. To make a long story short, when I started freelancing it was basically two friends and I three together and dreaming of becoming an entrepreneur at the same time.

After that, me and a friend of mine started a business together while freelancing which was basically a clothing related business, we were freelancing and the business was doing fairly well. Although we didn’t make the business very successful, there was a lot to learn from it and we did well overall while being fairly small.

Since then, the real story of being an entrepreneur has slowly started my agency and two or three other businesses online and moving forward with hopes of doing better in the future.
